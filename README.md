# Advanced_ML_DL_Course_Assignment_TV_Show_NLP_Classifier

**By: Raz Graider, Sophie Margolis, Ran Asanta and Dana Braynin**

In this project, we were given a dataset containing the scripts of all Seinfeld and Friends episodes.<br>
We were asked to create a deep learning model that could identify whether a line was taken from a Seinfeld episode or from a Friends episode.<br>
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. We were given 70,405  observations. We analyzed the given data, processed it and classified the samples in the test data.

We achieved a test score of 86.2191% using Keras Neural Network.
