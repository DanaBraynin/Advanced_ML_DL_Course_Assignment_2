# Advanced_ML_DL_Course_Assignment_2

In this project, we were given a dataset containing the scripts of all Seinfeld and Friends episodes.<br>
We were asked to create a deep learning model that could identify whether a line was taken from a Seinfeld episode or from a Friends episode.<br>
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. We were given 70,405  observations. We will analyze the given data, process it and classify the samples in the test data.
